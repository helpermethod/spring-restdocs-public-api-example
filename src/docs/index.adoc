= Introduction

The JSON Placeholder API is a RESTful web service that shows how Spring REST docs works for a public API.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

The Example API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, overwrites all fields

| `PATCH`
| Used for partial updates to an existing resource

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

The JSON Placeholder API uses a few status codes in the API.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist or the operation is not supported.

|===

For more information on status codes, see the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[w3 standard]

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error occurs, the body will contain an empty JSON object. For example:

include::{snippets}/error-example/curl-request.adoc[]

or

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-request.adoc[]

will respond with:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]
